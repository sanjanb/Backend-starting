# Lesson 5: Setting Up the Development Environment

Welcome to Lesson 5 of the Complete Backend Course! In this lesson, we'll set up our development environment to start building the subscription tracking API. Let's get started!

## Creating a New Project Folder

1. **Create a Project Folder:**
   - On your desktop, create a new folder named `subscription-tracker`.

## Opening the Project in a Code Editor

2. **Open the Project:**
   - Use a code editor of your choice. In this course, we'll use **WebStorm**, which is now free for non-commercial use. However, you can use any editor you prefer, such as VSCode or Sublime Text.

## Initializing an Express Application

3. **Initialize Express:**
   - Use the Express generator to quickly start a new Express.js application:
     ```bash
     npx express-generator --no-view --git ./
     ```
   - The `--no-view` flag skips the front-end setup, and `--git ./` initializes a Git repository in the current folder.

## Cleaning Up the Initial Project Structure

4. **Clean Up the Project:**
   - Delete unnecessary folders and files generated by the Express generator:
     - `bin`
     - `public`
     - `routes`
   - Clean up the contents within the `app.js` file to start with a clean slate.

## Installing Nodemon

5. **Install Nodemon:**
   - Nodemon is a development dependency that automatically restarts the server whenever code changes are made. Install it using:
     ```bash
     npm install -D --save-dev nodemon
     ```

## Configuring `package.json`

6. **Modify `package.json`:**
   - Change the name of the application (e.g., to `subdub`).
   - Add `"type": "module"` to enable the use of ES6 import modules.
   - Modify the `scripts` section to include:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "start": "node app.js",
       "dev": "nodemon app.js"
     }
     ```
   - The `start` script runs the application, and the `dev` script runs it with Nodemon for development.

## Setting Up a Linter (ESLint)

7. **Set Up ESLint:**
   - To maintain a clean codebase, initialize ESLint:
     ```bash
     npx eslint --init
     ```
   - Follow the configuration prompts:
     - Use ESLint to check syntax and find problems.
     - Specify the type of modules being used (ES modules).

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we've set up our development environment by creating a project folder, initializing an Express application, installing essential tools like Nodemon and ESLint, and configuring our project settings. This lays the groundwork for building our API in subsequent lessons.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
